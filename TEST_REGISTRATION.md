## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

Look for these in browser console:
- `‚úÖ User record created successfully`
- `‚úÖ User record verified in database`
- `‚úÖ Verification email resent successfully`

## ‚ùå Error Indicators

If you see these, fixes are working:
- Clear error messages in toasts
- No silent failures
- Form stays on page after error
- Loading state clears properly

## üîç Check Database

After successful registration:
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT id, email, username, full_name, is_active, email_verified_at, role
FROM users
WHERE username = 'testuser123';

-- Expected:
-- id: [UUID]
-- email: your-test-email@example.com
-- username: testuser123
-- full_name: Test User
-- is_active: false
-- email_verified_at: NULL
-- role: user
```

After email verification:
```sql
SELECT id, email, is_active, email_verified_at
FROM users
WHERE username = 'testuser123';

-- Expected:
-- is_active: true
-- email_verified_at: [timestamp]
```

## üêõ If Something Fails

1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Check Network tab for failed requests
3. Check Supabase logs
4. Verify environment variables are set
5. Verify database schema matches expected structure
