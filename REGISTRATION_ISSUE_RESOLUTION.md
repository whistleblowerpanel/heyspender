## 🔍 ISSUES IDENTIFIED & FIXED

### Critical Issues (Fixed):
1. ✅ **Username availability check** - Was failing silently, now properly handles all cases
2. ✅ **Email availability check** - Was throwing errors, now works correctly
3. ✅ **Input validation** - Added comprehensive validation before database checks
4. ✅ **Database record verification** - Now verifies user record creation before proceeding
5. ✅ **Error handling** - Improved error handling with automatic cleanup on failures
6. ✅ **Resend verification email** - Fixed hardcoded fallback email address
7. ✅ **Security vulnerability** - Removed hardcoded API key from client code

### What Was Wrong:

#### Issue #1: Silent Failures
**Problem:** Username and email checks used `.single()` which throws errors when no user is found, causing silent failures.

**Fix:** Changed to `.maybeSingle()` which returns null instead of throwing errors.

#### Issue #2: No Input Validation
**Problem:** Invalid data (like usernames with spaces) could be submitted, causing cryptic database errors.

**Fix:** Added comprehensive client-side validation:
- Username: 3-20 characters, alphanumeric + underscore only
- Password: minimum 8 characters
- Full name: minimum 2 characters

#### Issue #3: No Database Verification
**Problem:** After creating user in Supabase Auth, there was no check that the database record was actually created. Could lead to orphaned auth users.

**Fix:** Added verification step that:
- Confirms database record exists
- Cleans up auth user if database fails
- Shows clear error message to user

#### Issue #4: Poor Error Handling
**Problem:** Errors were caught but not properly handled, leading to unclear states.

**Fix:** Comprehensive error handling:
- All errors properly logged
- User feedback for all error cases
- Automatic cleanup on critical failures
- Clear distinction between recoverable and critical errors

#### Issue #5: Wrong Resend Email
**Problem:** Resend verification had fallback to wrong email address: `whistleblowerpanel@gmail.com`

**Fix:** Removed fallback, validates email parameter, redirects to registration if missing.

#### Issue #6: Security Issue
**Problem:** Verification page had hardcoded Supabase API key in direct fetch call.

**Fix:** Removed direct fetch call, now uses Supabase client properly.
