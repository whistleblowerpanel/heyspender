# 🚀 Quick Start: AVIF Image Storage

## ✅ What's Been Done

1. ✅ **Backup created:** `backup-before-avif-implementation` branch
2. ✅ **Sharp installed:** Image processing library added
3. ✅ **API route created:** `/api/upload-image` for AVIF conversion
4. ✅ **Storage service updated:** Feature flag support added
5. ✅ **Documentation created:** Comprehensive guides available

## 🎯 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Add Environment Variable

Create or edit `.env.local` in your project root:

```env
# AVIF Storage Feature (set to false initially for testing)
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_AVIF_STORAGE=false

# Your existing variables (keep these)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_key_here
# ... other variables
```

### Step 2: Restart Your Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Verify It's Working (Old Approach First)

1. Open your app at `http://localhost:3000`
2. Try uploading a wishlist cover image
3. Check console - should see:
   ```
   📸 Uploading image: example.jpg
      Storage mode: Data URL (Legacy)
   ✅ Upload successful (Data URL)
   ```

### Step 4: Enable AVIF Storage (When Ready)

1. Edit `.env.local`:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_AVIF_STORAGE=true
   ```

2. Restart server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Try uploading an image
4. Check console - should see:
   ```
   📸 Uploading image: example.jpg
      Storage mode: AVIF + Supabase Storage
   📸 Converting image to AVIF...
   ✅ Upload successful! Saved 75%
   ```

## 🔄 How to Rollback (If Needed)

**Instant rollback:**
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_AVIF_STORAGE=false
```

Then restart: `npm run dev`

**Complete rollback:**
```bash
git checkout backup-before-avif-implementation
npm run dev
```

- **Rollback Guide:** `AVIF_ROLLBACK_GUIDE.md`

## ✨ Features

### Organized Folders
Images are automatically organized:
- `wishlist-covers/` - Wishlist cover images
- `wishlist-items/` - Item images
- `item-images/` - Additional item images
- `General/` - Fallback folder

### Smart Fallback
If AVIF upload fails, automatically falls back to Data URL approach (your current system).

### Zero Risk
- Toggle on/off anytime with env variable
- No code changes needed
- Old system stays intact
- Can revert in 30 seconds

## 🎉 Benefits

- **60-80% smaller** file sizes
- **Faster** page loads
- **Reduced** database size
- **Proper** cloud storage
- **Better** scalability

## 📝 Notes

- Start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_AVIF_STORAGE=false` to ensure everything works
- Test thoroughly before setting to `true`
- Monitor console logs for any issues
- Keep backup branch for at least 30 days
